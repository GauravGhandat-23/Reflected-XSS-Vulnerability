# Reflected-XSS-Vulnerability
This project demonstrates the identification and exploitation of a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application's search functionality.

## Objectives
- Understand and exploit reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- Provide mitigation recommendations to prevent such vulnerabilities.

## Problem Statement
Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded. This lab contains a simple reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search functionality. To solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the `alert()` function.

## Steps to Exploit
1. **Access the Web Application:**
   - Open the web page containing the search functionality.

2. **Test the Search Field for Reflection:**
   - Enter a test string (e.g., `test`) in the search field and observe if it is reflected on the page.

3. **Craft an XSS Payload:**
   - Inject the following payload in the search field:
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```

4. **Submit the Payload:**
   - Submit the search form with the crafted payload.

5. **Observe the Result:**
   - If the vulnerability exists, a popup with the number "1" will appear, confirming the XSS attack.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all user inputs before processing or reflecting them in the application.
- **Output Encoding:**
  - Apply proper encoding for untrusted data before rendering it on the page.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
  - Implement a CSP to restrict sources of executable scripts.
- **Use Security Libraries:**
  - Utilize libraries like OWASP AntiSamy for automatic sanitization of inputs.

## Files Included
- **Documentation:**
  - `Reflected-XSS-Vulnerability Project File`: Detailed documentation of the project.
- **Sample Payloads:**
  - Example payloads to test the vulnerability.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of secure input handling and provides practical insights into identifying and mitigating XSS vulnerabilities. By following secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of such attacks.
